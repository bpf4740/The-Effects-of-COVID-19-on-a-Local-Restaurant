# The-Effects-of-COVID-19-on-a-Local-Restaurant

This paper shows the effect of the United States Government declaring the COVID19 pandemic a national emergency. This study was performed on one local restaurant
in upstate New York. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization classified
the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Two days later, March 13, 2020, the United
States issued a national emergency declaration. Subsequently, on March 15, 2020, the
Center for Disease Control laid out the first social distancing policy. Finally on March
20, 2020, New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, ordered all non-essential businesses to
close until further notice. Restaurants were allowed to stay open on a take out only
basis. This policy has had a drastic effect on local restaurants and its employees. The
number of people going to restaurants has plummeted, directly correlating to sales
revenue. Workers are being laid-off or forced to work limited hours, reducing employee
income. The purpose of this paper is to forecast the number of people serviced by this
restaurant through the month of May to visualize where business may go during this
unprecedented time.
